### Hi there, I'm Tore Nestenius ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an independent software consultant and trainer based in Helsingborg, Sweden.

I have many years of experience helping companies to develop better software. I do that by solving problems, educating and inspiring teams all around the world.

I love sharing knowledge through my training classes, webinars and one-on-one coaching.

When I am not working, I spend time on Stack overflow answering questions about CQRS, OpenID-Connect, IdentityServer and .NET.
